                <h4>You Will Stretch Your Brain</h4>
                <p class="third-width"> I have never been as challenged or stretched as I've been during my Blueprint with Skillcrush. At the same time I've never felt more confident. Learnin to code has given me the challenge that I've been lacking in life and if you're finding yoruself feeling a little stale I would definitely recommend you take the leap.</p>
                <p class="third-width"> Now if you're the type of person that likes things to be super easy and doesn't like a challenge then this might not be for you but you like a challenge and are willing to perservere then I say absolutely go for it! I realize I just said pretty much the same thing twice but that's becuase it's important!</p>
                <p class="third-width"> On a more practical note, tap in to your resources. If you join the Skillcrush fam, there is an amazing community of people ready and waiting to answer all the questions you can think of. All of the instructors are incredibly supportive and all the students I've interacted with are very kind. Whether you're working towards a life as a digital nomad like me or you're just wanting to make a little money as a side hustle, Skillcrush is a great place to start.</p>
